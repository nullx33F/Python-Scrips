# Python-Scrips
A repository containing all of my automated scripts that I have written. All scripts are explained line by line,
so you can view the code and develop it very easily.

## Scripts-List:

|  Script |  Description |
|---|---|
| XOR Encryption.py | Encrypt/Decrypt xor cipher using random or specific key |
| Hashpy.py | Calculate the hash value for plain-text, binary files and Check file integrity |
